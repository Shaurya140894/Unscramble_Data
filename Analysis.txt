Task 0:
Each function performs performs only one operation regardless of the size of data.
O(0n + 1) + O(0n + 1)
Therefore, Complexity = O(1)

Task 1:
There are two functions, one of which contains for loop.
O(1n + 1) + O(0n + 1)
Therefore, Complexity = O(n)

Task 2:
There are two functions in all and both contain for loop.
This gives the complexity of O(1n + 4) + O(1n + 3) = O(2n)
Therefore, Complexity = O(n)

Task 3:
In this task I have used 7 functions in total. 6 of those functions consist of for loop making worst case to be O(7n).
But I have also implemented .sorted() method which has complexity of O(n log n).
Therefore, Complexity = O(n log n)

Task 4:
In this task I have used 3 functions. 2 of these functions have loops making worst case complexity to be O(2n).
But in the last function I have implemented .sorted() method with complexity O(n log n).
Therefore, Complexity = O(n log n)
